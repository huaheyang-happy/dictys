**Checks before submitting the issue**
* [x] I installed the latest Dictys version successfully
* [ ] I downloaded the whole folder for the tutorial
* [ ] I ran the tutorial cells and notebooks (if more than one) in the correct order and only once
* [ ] The preceeding cells and notebooks finished successfully (i.e. the reported error is the first encountered)

**Describe the error**
* How did you install Dictys (which option)?
* Which tutorial?
* What (full message) and where (cell and notebook being executed) was the error?
* Did you deviate from any of the tutorial instructions?

**Optional steps (may accelerate troubleshooting)**
* Attach the error notebook and all preceeding notebooks with run output
